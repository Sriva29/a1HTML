    <p>Sri R</p>
    <article>
        <p>Movember is coming and its going to be a really chilly one this time around. On top of your jacket, your
            scarf, your hat, and your boots, why not use nature's winter gear? The mighty stache. Here are three styles
            guaranteed to keep you warm this winter. Ready to face Movember? Don these staches for a warm and cozy
            winter.</p>

        <h2>1. The Cowboy Stache</h2>
        <img src="img/article2img2.webp" alt="The Cowboy stache">
        <p>The Cowboy is the moustache style worn by Ron Swanson of Parks and Recreation.

            It's a longer, unkempt version of the Chevron. Instead of trimming your moustache to the top of your lips,
            allow it to grow until it touches your bottom lip. You won't have to worry about keeping this style too neat
            but trim it up once in a while so you don't look lazy.</p>

        <h2>2. The Handlebar</h2>
        <img src="img/article2img3.webp" alt="The Handlebar">
        <p>The Handlebar is a retro favorite and can be argued as one of the best moustache styles. To grow out the
            handlebar moustache style, let your moustache grow until it's over your upper lip. Then using moustache wax and
            a comb, part your hair over the middle of your lip.

            Spread the wax over your whole moustache (use the comb and a blow-dryer), then twist the ends up into a curl.
            For a tighter curl, use the end of a moustache comb and a pencil or pen.

            Check out more on our tips on how to style a Handlebar moustache. In the end, keep your handlebar moustache
            curled, twisted, and waxed.</p>

        <h2>3. The Walrus</h2>
        <img src="img/article2img3.webp" alt="The Walrus">
        <p>If you want to channel the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, then you want a Walrus moustache. The Walrus moustache
            style is iconic due to it's bushy, overhanging and long appearance.

            To master this look, you need the length of a Cowboy moustache and the styling of the relaxed Handlebar. Grow
            your moustache until it hangs over the edge of your lower lip. Keep the center of your facial hair trimmed,
            like scissors in a horseshoe shape.

            Then using wax, a comb, and a blow dryer, wrangle your facial hair into two equal parts. You can use the wax
            to turn the ends of your beard comb and your moustache up or let it hang.</p>
